Furthering CSS revision via FreeCodeCamp's CSS Grid resources and copying passed code to Git repo as I go through each task. Documenting below anything new I learn, which will be most of module as I am currently unfamiliar with grid.

- Learned to create initial grid with columns and rows.
    - Initiated by diplay:grid.
    - Add rows or columns with grid-template-columns / grid-template-rows. Values are given one after the other, not comma separated.
